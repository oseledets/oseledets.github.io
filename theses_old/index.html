<h3>Low-rank approximation for recommender&nbsp;systems.</h3>
<p>Recommender systems play a crucial role in the internet trade. The mathematical and algorithmical 
problems that appear are intrinsically related to the approximation of very sparse matrices and tensors. 
A typical case is when a recommender system is learned off-line, and then applied in a online phase. 
In the time of promotions the priorities of the buyers change tremendously, thus fast online learning methods
are required. The goal of this work is to develop new algorithms for those tasks. This is a joint project with 
a Tratata <span class="caps">AG</span> (webref) which is a leading company in the field in&nbsp;Europe. </p>

<h3>Tensor train approximation for learning graphical&nbsp;models</h3>
<p>Graphical models are powerful models for the joint distributions of random variables. Such joint distributions are typically
extremely high-dimensional, and graphical models allow compact represenations. However, the problem of learning a graphical model 
for the case when a corresponding graph has no cycles, is <span class="caps">NP</span>-hard. The goal of this project is to develop fast numerical techniques
based on the Tensor Train (<span class="caps">TT</span>)-decomposition and related algorithm to learn graphical&nbsp;models. </p>
<h3>Digital data compression (video and beyond) using Wavelet Tensor Train&nbsp;decomposition</h3>
<p>Digital data is becoming more and more high-dimensional, thus compression techniques are almost always necessary. This project poses an
ambitious task for creating a new video compression algorithm and software based on the so-called Wavelet Tensor Train (<span class="caps">WTT</span>) decomposition. 
Preliminary experiments show that such an approach can be competitive with state-of-art codecs. However, a good compression algorithm consists of many
parts. The <span class="caps">WTT</span> algorithm involves only the first part, which is related to the continious transformation step. It is a purely algebraical technique which involves the computation of auxiliary singular value&nbsp;decompositions. </p>
<p>The goal of this project is to develop a prototype implementation of a <span class="caps">WTT</span>-based video codec and compare it with state-of-art codes available. A possible direction is for the compression of a high-dimensional arrays coming, for example, from 3D television problems. The <span class="caps">WTT</span> algorithm is not constraint for videos and images: its main concept allows it to work for arrays of different nature with a similar&nbsp;efficiency.</p>
